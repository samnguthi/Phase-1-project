# Phase-1-project
For this project, you will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
## Business Problem
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.

This involves Loading of the data, getting and handling duplicates as well as missing data. Presenting the data visually 
## DATA VISUALIZATION
We are in a century where there's literally a technology for everything. To visualise the data we have , we have powerful tools that ease the process of creation of data visuals
